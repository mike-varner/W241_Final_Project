_Abstract_

How does changing default gratuity settings impact pre-service tipping behavior at coffee shops? In the United States, tipping is a critical component of many workersâ€™ income in the food and beverage industry and default gratuity settings on point-of-sale (POS) systems have become increasingly widespread. Prior research has shown that increasing the range of default tipping recommendations leads to fewer tips but higher overall revenue from those that do tip. We investigated whether increasing some but not all default tip options leads to higher average tip percentages. We conducted a between-subjects, two group, post-test randomized experiment at two coffee shops: Mercury Cafe and Ryan Bros (located in San Francisco and San Diego repsectively). All patrons who visited one of these coffee shops, while the experiment was being conducted and who paid with a Debit or Credit card only, had their transaction randomized to the control group (N = 270) or treatment group (N = 279). We found that on average, individuals in the treatment group tipped 1.2% higher than individuals in the control group. However, this finding was not significant at a 5% level. Our results are encouraging, however, as relatively modest increases in default settings (3-5%) can lead to higher tip revenue. Moving forward, we recommend increasing the sample size and adjusting the treatment tip percentages to be even higher in order to achieve sufficient power and further investigate this relationship.
